# Introduction to Galois Theory

This is a note to provide an introduction to galois theory, and its application in the solvability of algebraic equations and straightedge-and-compass constructions.

This note is self-contained except:

- basic knowledge of fields: see remark 1.1 - remark 1.5
- sylow theorems

Any problems (including the correctness and readability of the text) are welcomed.
