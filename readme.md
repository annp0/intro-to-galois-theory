# Introduction to Galois Theory

This is a note to provide an introduction to galois theory, and its application in the solvability of algebraic equations and straightedge-and-compass constructions.

This note is self-contained except:

- the classification theorem of abelian groups
- sylow theorems

Any problems (including the correctness and readability of the text) are welcomed.
