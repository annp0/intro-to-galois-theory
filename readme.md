# Introduction to Galois Theory

This is a note to provide an introduction to galois theory, and its application in the solvability of algebraic equations and straightedge-and-compass constructions.

The text can be found [here](https://github.com/annp0/intro-to-galois-theory/blob/main/main.pdf).

This note is self-contained except:

- basic knowledge of fields and groups, see section 1: Preliminaries.

Any problems (including the correctness and readability of the text) are welcomed.
